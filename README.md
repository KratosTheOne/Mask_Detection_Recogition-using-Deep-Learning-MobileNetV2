# Mask_Detection_Recogition-using-Deep-Learning-MobileNetV2
This Repository contains all the files for the Machine Learning Project of Mask detection and recognition using Deep learning, Keras, Transfer learning and the new MobileNetV2.

Read about the documentation of the architecture of MobileNetV2 and transfer learning.

Feel free to share and make upgrades.

Just Download all the files in a folder and the Destination addresses accordingly.

# Requirements:-
# INSTALL Anaconda on your system.
